# Emoji Goldberg Puzzle

Emoji Goldberg Puzzle is a multiplayer collaborative puzzle game inspired by Rube Goldberg machines. Players work together in real time to build elaborate contraptions that guide a ball to its target. Every level is procedurally generated, ensuring a fresh challenge each time you play.

## Gameplay Overview
- **Collaborative solving** – everyone on the server shares the same puzzle. Players place or adjust pieces simultaneously to achieve a solution.
- **Emoji identification** – each player is represented by a unique emoji tied to their IP address. This creates a playful, intuitive way to see who is acting in the puzzle.
- **Physics-based pieces** – ramps, springs, fans, levers, conveyors and more interact using realistic 2D physics.
- **Perspective switching** – seamlessly toggle between top‑down and side views to place components precisely.

## Core Features
- **Procedurally generated puzzles** that encourage experimentation and replayability.
- **Colorful 2D art** with smooth animations and whimsical effects.
- **Real-time multiplayer** with synchronized updates so everyone stays on the same page.
- **Scaling difficulty** to keep new and experienced players engaged.

## Visual and Animation Quality
- Assets should be crisp and modern, using a consistent palette with complementary colors.
- Animations should play at 60 fps with easing curves for a polished feel.
- Transitions between puzzle states must be smooth and clearly convey player actions.

Optional cosmetic upgrades allow players to customize puzzle pieces and expand their emoji collection.
